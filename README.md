# Milk Safe Cloud Solution

Stagin environment coming soon

## Setup

### Installing and Running

First step is to install all the packages locally. Do this by running:

```bash
yarn
```

Then to load your app, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

And to build for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Folder Structure

Please refer to the Nodes frontend documentation on folder structure [here](https://github.com/nodes-frontend/readme/blob/master/Documentation/folder-structure.md).

### Importing

We have set up the project with absolute imports. Which means that instead of doing this:

```tsx
import Header from "../../../../components/Header/Header";
```

You can now import like this:

```tsx
import Header from "app/components/Header/Header";
```
